The official Asphyxia Plugin (up to Festo) also stores data in the same format so it will work.

Pass in your `jubeat@asphyxia.db` as `-f` or `--file`, this can be found in the `savedata` folder of wherever your Asphyxia executable is.

Your Profile ID can be found by going to  `Asphyxia WebUI -> Profile` and copy the ID there for the appropriate profile
